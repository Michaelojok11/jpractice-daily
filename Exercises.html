    <!-- Exercise 1 -->
    <!-- Question 1
        Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day (Use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
        If hour is between 6 and 12 , display "Good morning!" in the console
        If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
        Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console
     -->
      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <!-- Continuing from the question above, try changing the value in the hour  
    Question 3
     continuing from question 1 , create a variable called 'name' nad save your name inside (as a string). Update the if-statement to display your name in each message. For example:'Good morning ${name}!'-->
     
     <script>
        const hour = 13.40;
        const name = 'Michael';
  
        if (hour >= 6 && hour <= 12) {

        } else if (hour >= 13 && hour <= 17) {

        } else {
        console.log(`Good night ${name}!`);
        }


        /* Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
        Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
        Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display
        'No discount' in the console.
        Note: Try to use the || operator in your solution. Try changing the age variabel to display different messages.            */
