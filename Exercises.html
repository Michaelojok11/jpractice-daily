    <!-- Exercise 1 -->
    <!-- Question 1
        Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day (Use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
        If hour is between 6 and 12 , display "Good morning!" in the console
        If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
        Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console
     -->

     <script>
        const hour = 13.40;
        const name = 'Michael';
  
        if (hour >= 6 && hour <= 12) {
          console.log(`Good morning!' ${name}!`);
        } else if (hour >= 13 && hour <= 17) {
          console.log(`Good afternoon! ${name}!`);
        } else {
        console.log(`Good night ${name}!`);
        }

        // Question 2
        // Continuing from the question above, try changing the value in the hour 

        // Question 3
        // continuing from question 1 , create a variable called 'name' nad save your name inside (as a string). Update the if-statement to display your name in each message. For example:'Good morning ${name}!'
