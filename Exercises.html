    <!-- Exercise 1 -->
    <!-- Question 1
        Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day (Use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
        If hour is between 6 and 12 , display "Good morning!" in the console
        If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
        Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console
     -->
      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <!-- Continuing from the question above, try changing the value in the hour  
    Question 3
     continuing from question 1 , create a variable called 'name' nad save your name inside (as a string). Update the if-statement to display your name in each message. For example:'Good morning ${name}!'-->

        'No discount' in the console.
