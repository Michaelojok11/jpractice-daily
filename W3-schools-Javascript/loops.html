        // For Loop
        // The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions
        //  for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) { code to be executed}
        // Expression 1- is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block, it initializes the variable used in the loop
        // Expression 2 - defines the condition for executing the code block
        // Expression 3 - is executed (everytime) after the code block has been executed.
